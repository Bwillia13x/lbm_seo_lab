## Recommended Pitch (1‑minute)

“Let’s start with a one‑time setup ($1,750) to configure the toolkit, lock in your Google review link and QR assets, and train your team. From there, the Core plan ($850/mo) gives you steady momentum—weekly content, ranking checks, and ongoing citation/link work—so you see measurable growth without adding tasks to your day. If you prefer to self‑manage content, the Platform‑Only license is $1,200/year with optional à‑la‑carte support.”
