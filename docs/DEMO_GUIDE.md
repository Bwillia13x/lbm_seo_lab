# Belmont SEO Lab – Demo Guide

This guide walks you through a smooth, 7–10 minute demo that showcases the platform’s value, using built‑in demo data. No external services required.

## 1) Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Clone the repo, then:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Tip: Simple Mode is on by default and hides advanced controls for a cleaner demo. Toggle it from the header if you want to show advanced features.

## 2) Opening Flow (1 minute)
- Landing page → click Get Started (goes to Onboarding)
- Onboarding shows what it does in one sentence; nothing to fill for the demo

## 3) Executive Dashboard (2–3 minutes)
- Go to Dashboard → click Load Demo Metrics
- Walk through the visuals:
  - KPIs (30 days): Links, QR Scans, Bookings, Reviews, Avg Rating
  - 30‑Day Trends: Links, Bookings, Reviews
  - Attribution Pie: Top UTM sources
  - Funnel: Links → Scans → Bookings
  - Goals & Alerts: simple checks (rating, reviews, posting cadence, WoW change, onboarding)
- Export/Print: use Export Snapshot (CSV) or Print (for PDF)

Optional: Reset Demo to clear events.

## 4) First Win: Create a Tracking Link (1–2 minutes)
- Open UTM Dashboard → click Load Demo (shows sample campaigns + QR)
- Or build one live: Base URL (booking link) → choose preset → Generate UTM → Copy Link
- Explain: These links reveal which posts and channels drive bookings

## 5) QR Code (1 minute)
- Open QR Maker → click Load Demo
- Present the ASCII QR preview and link
- Note: Use QR on window, cards, flyers; tracking remains intact

## 6) Reviews (1 minute)
- Open Review Request Links
- Briefly show “What this tool does” card
- Generate Google/Apple review links; copy Email/SMS templates
- Mention: CASL-friendly; optional Consent Log

## 7) Content (1–2 minutes)
- Google Business Profile Composer → show How To and Compose
- Post Studio → click Load Belmont Sample to generate Instagram + GBP examples
- Emphasize: Brand voice, local relevance, booking links in every post

## 8) Rankings & Partners (optional, 1–2 minutes)
- Rank Grid → Load Demo and show status; Monitoring in Rankgrid Watcher
- Partnership Map → Load Sample Prospects; explain local outreach angle

## 9) Close with Outcomes
- Show Dashboard again to tie work to KPIs (links, scans, bookings, reviews)
- Summarize: Simple workflow, visible results, privacy‑friendly (client‑side)

## Troubleshooting
- If demo visuals look empty: click Load Demo Metrics on Dashboard; use Load Demo/Load Sample buttons on relevant tools
- To reset the environment: use Reset Demo on Dashboard; Onboarding has Reset too
- If the browser has stale state: clear site data for localhost and refresh

## Post‑Demo Notes
- Simple Mode hides advanced features by default; switch to Advanced for power users
- All demo data stays in your browser only (localStorage)

Enjoy your demo!
